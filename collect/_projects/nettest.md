# nettest

Nettest was a cross platform, distributed network measurement tool designed to passively monitor a users connection to the Internet. It collected information about latency, throughput, interesting TCP flags, packet reordering and more, and reported these back to our central server where the data was aggregated and graphed. Individual users could view their own detail statistics, but others were limited to aggregate views of the data, filtered by ISP and location.

The nettest experiment is now over and the prototype code is no longer available for download. If you have any questions about nettest or related work then please email [contact@wand.net.nz](mailto:contact@wand.net.nz).

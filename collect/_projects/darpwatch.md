# Darpwatch

Darpwatch is a solution for monitoring ethernet activity across many different ethernet networks. Darpwatch is based on the original arpwatch source from UCB.

- Reporting and Analysis server that collects reports from monitoring daemons and generates alerts.

**Features**

- Modular alert handling - write your own alert handler
- Scalable
- Based on original arpwatch code

**Planned Features**

- Modular database backend (currently uses Postgres)
- More as they are suggested
- Distribution Packages (debs, rpms)

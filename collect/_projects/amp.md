# AMP

The Active Measurement Project (AMP) is a monitoring platform designed to perform continuous, distributed, black-box active network measurement. Each AMP probe independently schedules and runs a variety of tests, as well as acting as a cooperative endpoint for tests run by other probes. Currently available tests include ICMP and TCP latency, UDP DNS latency, TCP throughput, HTTP performance and video streaming performance.

The collected data is stored centrally and is made available in real-time for tasks such as event detection, and is also available on-demand to users through a web interface. Users can explore graphs of historical data, at-a-glance dashboards of current measurements, or export data for use with other tools.

There are AMP probes deployed at many universities in New Zealand, and at many New Zealand Internet Service Providers, all with publicly available data. AMP is also being used internally by a number of ISPs to monitor customer experience and infrastructure performance. If you are interested in hosting a public AMP probe in your organisation then please [get in touch](https://wand.net.nz/amp/request/monitor). You can also [suggest new targets](https://wand.net.nz/amp/request/target) that should be tested. If you have any other questions then please email [contact@wand.net.nz](mailto:contact@wand.net.nz).

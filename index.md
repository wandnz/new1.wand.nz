# WAND Group

WAND was the Network Research Group at the [University of Waikato](http://www.waikato.ac.nz/) [Computer Science Department](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/)
from 1997 until 2022.

The group was involved with a range of computer networks projects mostly focused around network measurement and software defined networks.
The group had a strong international reputation and had close links, including collaborative research, with several other network measurement groups.
These included CAIDA, [RIPE NCC](https://www.ripe.net/) and [Google](https://www.google.com/).

Our work included the collection of very long trace sets, network analysis and software to support this, active measurement systems, topology discovery and analysis and SDN controllers.
Spinoff companies from our previous work include [Endace](http://www.endace.com/) and [Lightwire](https://www.lightwire.co.nz/).

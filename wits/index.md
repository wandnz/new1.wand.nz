### Introduction

The Waikato Internet Traffic Storage project aims to collect and document all the Internet traces that the WAND Group has in their possession. Some of these trace sets are now freely available for researchers to download. We hope to continue releasing other traces in the future. 

**NEW:** Many of the traces hosted on WITS can now be downloaded from the [RIPE NCC Internet Measurement Data Repository](http://labs.ripe.net/datarepository). You will need to sign up to RIPE Labs and accept terms and conditions prior to download through their site, but IPv6 access via a research network is not required to access the data in the RIPE repository. So, if you are unable to download traces from WITS it may be worth attempting to get them from the RIPE repository.

### Processing Traces

We strongly recommend using [Libtrace](https://github.com/LibtraceTeam/libtrace/wiki) for any processing tasks you might want to perform on the traces in the WITS archive.
